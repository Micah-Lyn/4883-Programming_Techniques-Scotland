10017 - The Never Ending Towers of Hanoi
### Micah-Lyn Scotland
### Description:


Rules of the puzzle:
• There are three pegs: A, B and C.
• There are n disks. The number n is constant while working the puzzle.
• All disks are different in size.
• The disks are initially stacked on peg A so that they increase in size from the top to the bottom.
• The goal of the puzzle is to transfer the entire tower from the A peg to the peg C.
• One disk at a time can be moved from the top of a stack either to an empty peg or to a peg with
a larger disk than itself on the top of its stack.

Your job will be to write a program which will show a copy of the puzzle on the screen step by step,
as you move the disks around. This program has to solve the problem in an efficient way.
