12347 - Binary Search Tree
### Micah-Lyn Scotland
### Description:

A binary search tree is a binary tree that satisfies the following properties:
• The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node’s key.
• The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
• Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

The goal of this proagram was to find the post order traversal of a given tree , using the pre order traversal of a binary search tree.
