540 - Team Queue
### Micah-Lyn Scotland
### Description:

This program simulates a team queue. In a team queue each element belongs to a team. If an element enters the queue, it first searches
the queue from head to tail to check if some of its teammates (elements of the same team) are already
in the queue. If yes, it enters the queue right behind them. If not, it enters the queue at the tail
and becomes the new last element (bad luck). Dequeuing is done like in normal queues: elements are
processed from head to tail in the order they appear in the team queue.
