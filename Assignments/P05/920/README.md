920 - Sunny Mountains
### Micah-Lyn Scotland
### Description:

During their honeymoon, Mrs and Mr Smith went to the Himalayas. How they were surprised when they observed that, during the sunset, all the snow touched by the sunbeams turned red. Such a magnificent landscape leaves everyone plenty of emotion, but Mr Smith’s number obsession overcame all this. He rapidly began evaluating distances, which made Mrs Smith quite upset. Your work is to help him calculate the size, in meters, of the mountainsides that became red as the sun sets. Mr Smith’s honeymoon depends on you! Please be quick and efficient. For the sake of simplicity, consider that, during the sunset, the sunbeams are horizontal and assume that the landscape is described by the set of coordinates of the mountain peaks and cols. This can be depicted by the following figure. A landscape, in this context, is then a sequence of peaks and cols (i.e., only a col follows a peak and conversely).
