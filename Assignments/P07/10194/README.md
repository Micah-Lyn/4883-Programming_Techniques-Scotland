### Micah-Lyn Scotland
### Description:

 This program receives the tournament name, team names and
games played and outputs the tournament standings so far.
A team wins a game if it scores more goals than its oponent. Obviously, a team loses a game if it
scores less goals. When both teams score the same number of goals, we call it a tie. A team earns 3
points for each win, 1 point for each tie and 0 point for each loss.
Teams are ranked according to these rules (in this order):
1. Most points earned.
2. Most wins.
3. Most goal difference (i.e. goals scored - goals against)
4. Most goals scored.
5. Less games played.
6. Lexicographic order.
